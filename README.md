Student Financing Website

This website aims to allow students to keep track of account balances, income and expenses, and see their overall spending habits over set time periods.

  Code Quality
We have written all of the code to be as easy to change and read as possible, using comments and formatting to our advantage, as well as making all of the
code modular.

  User Experience
This website takes advantage of intuitive UI, as well all features being present on one page, with validated user input. 
All of these things combined result in a hassle-free, and seamless user experience.

  Functionality
The website currently has no known bugs or issues, and should perform as intended, with no spikes in performance.

The program is written to store any inputted data locally, which means that users can leave and come back, while keeping all of their progress.

  Accessibility
Finally, there are options for light and dark modes, and a Help tab to addresss any issues or hiccups that users may encounter.
